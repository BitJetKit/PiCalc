PiCalc
======

A simple Pi Calculator done in java.
I used the [Spigot Algorithm] published by Jeremy Gibbons to perform the calculations.
This pretty much is a simple translation of the [Unbounded Spigot Algorithms for the Digits of Pi].

The results can be found in your user folder with the name `output.pi`
